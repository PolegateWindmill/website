It was then worked by auxiliary engine, latterly an electric motor, until 1965. By the time the mill stopped working, it was becoming derelict. Eastbourne and District Preservation Trust was established for the specific purpose of buying the mill and grounds, and a restoration was carried out by E Hole and Sons, the Burgess Hill millwrights. One of the new stocks broke in July 1974, bringing the sail with it. This particular stock was only seven years old. Thompson's, the Alford millwrights fitted a replacement stock and two new sails in May 1976. Further restoration work was undertaken in 2004, including the fitting of a cowl to the adjoining malthouse. Two new sails were fitted in 2009.</p>\n<p>By the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a lack of financial support and an ageing committee had lead to a hiatus where no-one was really looking after the windmill and it suffered further detoriation due to water ingress and deathwatch beetle infestation.</p>\n<p>In 2023 a new group of volunteers began to rally, starting with Tim Hogben and John Bassett, who were appointed Trustee Directors by the outgoing leadership. By the end of the year more than a dozen regulars now form the Wednesday work team and several have put themselves forward to be elected as trustees at the next AGM in early 2024 to form the management team going forward.</p>\n<p>The team are now working on cleaning up, maintaining and protecting the buildings and their treasures within as best as possible with the limited resources they have, as well as updating and improving the museum displays. However there remains a great deal of critical structural work necessary that is beyond the means and abilities of the Wednesday work team.</p>\n<p>We have recently commissioned a full survey by a well-reputed surveyor who has undertaken similar work in the past for Wealden District Council and Historic England. On the strength of this we hope to be able to break the full renovation down into smaller work units that can be completed in phases, the first of which of course being that work which is critically necessary to prevent collapse.</p>\n<p>Photo by Adrian Backshall</p>"}]}}}
