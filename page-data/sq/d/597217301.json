This is a legacy of how the organisation was set up in 1965.\nA newer legal structure called the \"Charitable Incorporated Organisation\" or CIO has since been introduced that allows charities to have limited liability and own freehold property without needing to be registered with Companies House and being subject to company law. It is currently our intention to convert to a CIO at some point in the future, though we have decided to retain the current structure for the immediate future to avoid confusion when applying for various grants and permissions.</p>","frontmatter":{"sectionId":"legal"}},{"html":"<p>This is a statically generated website that does not collect any personal data.
